1. FINDING PLACE TO BUILD HOME:
    
> You can go to public building area from the teleport chamber

> You can choose your own area to build (abiding by the rules)

>  Ask other experienced player for help finding suitable area near them or ask for mutual agreement to build with them or close to them if they are interested. 

> If anything of the above didn't work, drop a mail to tm3 or juli. They will be happy to help you find a suitable area.

>  There are 3 commands not to lose already found out areas. This is very good for quick teleporting between mines and home.
# First command is /sethome and /home
# Second is /sethome2 and /home2
# Third is 2 GUI buttons with a home signs on them in the left bottom of the inventory or crafting page.

2. AIR and FILLING UP GAS BOTTLE, SPACESUIT:

> If you are out of air go to spawn (type /spawn) and then down to the air chamber. 

> Fill up your gas bottle with right clicking on the air generator while having gas bottle in hand.

> Your spacesuit fills up automatically in air chamber don't get worried. 

NOTE: You must keep the spacesuit in the FIRST SLOT OF HUD to be able to wear it. Otherwise, you will die.

WARNING - 1: There is currently no recipe to make a spacesuit. It comes fully loaded since you join here. You can upgrade them with different materials (check in-built crafting guide). So, don't lose it.

WARNING - 2: You can't hold air tightly forever. So, Air likes to leak. It leaks after 30 mins. (Real Time) with a 50% probability / chance. So, you must  generate air  from air generator after that.  This can cause death of pets and domestic animals if you have any. To, fix this you can use mesecon to activate the air generator. YES! The air generator is compatible with Mesecons. :)

PS: It often make sense to initially ask other people for some basic stuff. We are friendly here and will be happy to help you survive.

3. DIGGING DOWN FOR RESOURCES:

> Dig down in Canyons or Public mines to get some quick ICE and CLAY / DIRT!!

> You can dig down right below your home too.

> It often make sense to go to Public mine at first to dig resources though; as different levels are easily available through elevators. Also, it has a Public Repair and Recharge Station which contain all kinds of machineries to process resources (except uranium enrichment) . Check the teleport room below air chamber.

NOTE: tm3 has a travelnet in the teleport room to a ice cave, where you can find lot of ice and even clay/dirt near by. Don't take too much of it though. You just need few. Don't get greedy. :)

> You should be digging down for iron and oxygen blocks as soon as possible.

> Craft an air-generator from oxygen and iron. For the exact craft receipe search in the in-built crafting guide for "air generator".

> For any other  "marsblocks" you can find it in in-built crafting guide if u search for the term "mars".

NOTE: if u don't know how to build something ask people especially Moderators or Supervisors

4. INITIAL PROCESSING OF RESOURCES:
 
> Cook the ICE in a furnace to get water source. Place it on top of stone or any other building materials. (NOT ON SAND; else it will disappear!!!)

NOTE: Use furnace in public mine to cook your ice super fast :)

> Similarly, for other resources you can use "Public Mine Repair Recharge Station FAR1" to not only process the ores but to even extract, compress, grind things. Also, you can repair your mechanical tools and recharge your electrical tools there.
 
5. GETTING DIRT AND TREE:

> Put some cobblestone near water and they change to mossycobble. 

> With mossycobble and clay you can craft a TREE. 

> With mossycobble you can also craft compost. 

PS: Seems lke you can almost automate this stuff with some mesecon isn't it?? (If you know what i am talking about :P)

NOTE: DON'T EAT ALL YOUR APPLES, YOU MAY NEED IT FOR CRAFTING.

> Put the compost in a WODDEN BARREL you will get dirt. 

> On dirt, many plants grow naturally and can be grown and harvest and regrown with seeds; which you can eat. Dig some naturally grown plants to get seeds. Use Heavy light source like "superglow glass" or "scifi twin lights" for faster grass propagation and plant growth :)

> There is another far better and faster way to get dirt. But, you have to have knowledge of technic machines for this. :)

CONGRATULATION! u can now stay alive on mars ;)
