HOW TO TELEPORT:

There are 3 commands to help you not loose already found out areas. This is very good for quick teleporting between mines and home.

> First command is /sethome and /home

> Second is /sethome2 and /home2

> Third is 2 GUI buttons with a home signs on them in the left bottom of the inventory or crafting page.

> You can place also a travelnet box (you have to craft it first) and put it at the public travel center in SPAWN.
(Ask the Supervisors for that)
