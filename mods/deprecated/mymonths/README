This mod adds months, weeks and days to Minetest.
A Minetest year has 12 months with 2 weeks per month. Each week has 7 days. 

The weather is depended on the time of year. If it is winter then it will snow spring has rain etc. 
Leaves turn color in the fall and the the tree will have no leaves or apples through the winter. 
The leaves grow back in the spring and the apples later in the year.
Acacia trees will bloom in January

The desert and savannah biomes do not get rain or snow but do have sand storms.
The snow biomes do not get rain.

The trees in these biomes do not loose their leaves. 


Each morning at 6am a chat message will say the date. If the day is a holiday it will show in chat with the morning date.

If you are caught in a storm you will need to seek shelter. Rain or snow does nothingbut if you are in a storm, snowstorm, 
sandstorm or hail you will recieve damage. You need to cover yourself so you do not recieve damage.
