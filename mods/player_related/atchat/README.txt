This once was redsand, but now only includes a tell/reply mechanism by @ character

@player text
@player:text
sends private message to player

@player1,player2 text
@player1,player2:text
sends private message to players

@ text
like redsand's reply command, but with one important difference: sends message to the last player(s) that YOU spoke to privately.

Since this was redsand, see license in license.txt
